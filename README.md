# Portfolio Website

This is a portfolio website for showcasing my projects and skills. The website features the following:

- A responsive design that adjusts to the size of the screen, allowing it to be easily viewed on mobile devices
- A navigation menu with links to different sections of the website
- A home page with a summary of the portfolio and information about the focus of the projects
- A projects list with a list of cybersecurity projects, including descriptions and links to more information
- An about section with information about the purpose and goals of the portfolio
- A contact section for visitors to get in touch with the owner of the portfolio

The website uses HTML, CSS, and some basic JavaScript for the contact form. It is designed to be clean and easy to navigate, with a professional look and feel. The portfolio is focused on demonstrating expertise and knowledge with projects, with an emphasis on practical, real-world applications.
